## Kivy Lifecycle

It consist of some things

- `__init__`, your app needs to inherit the App class, and setup some variables and properties
- `build()` create the UI (root widget) return widget
- `on_start()` called after build, to setup event listener, animation and background tasks
- `on_pause()`
- `on_resume()`
- `on_stop()`

## Kivy Best Practices Project Structure

Kivy follows the MVC pattern achitecture.

```yaml
my_kivy_app/          # Root project directory
â”‚â”€â”€ main.py           # Entry point of the application
â”‚â”€â”€ myapp.kv          # KV file (UI structure)
â”‚â”€â”€ assets/           # Assets (images, sounds, fonts)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sounds/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fonts/
â”‚â”€â”€ modules/          # Additional modules (optional)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ screens.py    # Screen management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ widgets.py    # Custom widgets
â”‚â”€â”€ models/           # Data models (optional)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data.py       # Data processing
â”‚â”€â”€ controllers/      # Business logic (optional)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ events.py     # Event handling
â”‚â”€â”€ README.md         # Documentation
â”‚â”€â”€ requirements.txt  # Dependencies (if any)
```

## How to load KV

There are two ways to load Kv code into your application:

- By name convention:

Kivy looks for a Kv file with the same name as your App class in lowercase, minus `App`f it ends with â€˜Appâ€™ e.g:

```
MyApp -> my.kv
```

If this file defines a Root Widget it will be attached to the Appâ€™s root attribute and used as the base of the application widget tree.

- Builder: You can tell Kivy to directly load a string or a file. If this string or file defines a root widget, it will be returned by the method:

```python
from kivy.lang import Builder

Builder.load_file('path/to/file.kv')
```

or:

```python
Builder.load_string(kv_string)
```

So basically, Kivy is consist of Widget and the Layout is also considered Widgets.

## Rule Context

For creating the file `py` and `kv`, there are two rules that I must to follow

- Root Rule (No bracket <>, must explicitly defined at the top of the Kv files, access using `app` keyword)
- Class Rule (With bracker, can use the `root` keyword to access the logic in python files)

Root rule is something that isn't defined in the python (implicitly defined in kv), it's been handled to the Kv, so we don't need to create the class and return it

```python
class MyApp(App):
    def build(self):
        return Builder.load_file("myapp.kv")

MyApp().run()

---

BoxLayout:  # Root Rule (No `< >`)
    orientation: "vertical"

    Label:
        text: "Hello, Kivy!"

    Button:
        text: "Click Me"
```

Class rule on the other hand use bracket and can be inside either custom widget / layout. it can uses the `root` to access the methods. Oh ya, it also needs to inherit from the `Widget` class. and instantiated manually

```python
class CustomBox(BoxLayout):  # Must instantiate in Python
    pass

class MyApp(App):
    def build(self):
        return CustomBox()  # Needs explicit instantiation

MyApp().run()
```

Example of using Custom class rule inside a main container.

```python
# Custom widget class (linked to `<CustomBox>` rule in KV)
class CustomBox(BoxLayout):
    def update_label(self):
        """Updates the label text when the button is pressed."""
        self.ids.custom_label.text = "Updated by root!"

---

# ðŸ”¹ Class Rule: Custom widget definition
<CustomBox>:
    orientation: "vertical"
    padding: 10
    spacing: 10

    Label:
        id: custom_label
        text: "Original Text"  # This label will be updated using `root`

    Button:
        text: "Update Label (root)"
        on_release: root.update_label()  # Calls the method in `CustomBox`
```

## Sample Code

```python
from kivy.app import App
from kivy.uix.boxlayout import BoxLayout
from kivy.lang import Builder

# Define a Custom Layout that inherits from BoxLayout
class CustomBox(BoxLayout):
    def update_label(self):
        """Updates the label text when the button is clicked."""
        self.ids.custom_label.text = "Updated by root!"

class MyApp(App):
    global_text = "Hello from App!"

    def change_global_text(self):
        """Updates the global label text."""
        self.root.ids.global_label.text = "Updated by app!"

    def build(self):
        return Builder.load_file("myapp.kv")

MyApp().run()
```

```kivy
# ðŸ”¹ Class Rule: Custom layout with a button that updates the label
<CustomBox>:
    orientation: "vertical"
    padding: 10
    spacing: 10

    Label:
        id: custom_label
        text: "Original Text"

    BoxLayout:  # Sub-child layout
        orientation: "horizontal"
        Button:
            text: "Update (root)"
            on_release: root.update_label()  # Calls function in `CustomBox`
        Button:
            text: "Access Global (app)"
            on_release: app.change_global_text()  # Calls function in `MyApp`

# ðŸ”¹ Root Rule: Defines the main UI structure
BoxLayout:
    orientation: "vertical"
    padding: 20
    spacing: 10

    Label:
        id: global_label
        text: app.global_text  # Accessing a variable from `MyApp`

    Button:
        text: "Update Global Label (app)"
        on_release: app.change_global_text()  # Calls a global function in `MyApp`

    CustomBox:  # Custom widget instance
```

## Event and Properties

In Kivy, events are how widgets communicate and respond to user interactions (e.g., button clicks, text input, touch gestures). Event binding is the mechanism that links an event (like on_press) to a function that handles the event.

- Types of event
- Touch Event (on_touch_down, on_touch_up, on_pressed)
- Widget-based event (button for on_press, on_release)
- Custom event for Custom Widget

For properties, you can use setter / getter mechanism out of that.

```python
<MyWidget>:
    my_text: "Hello, Kivy!"
    Label:
        text: my_text  # Automatically updates when `my_text` changes

---

## Modify in the Python
self.my_text = "New text!"  # Updates UI instantly
```

You can use the `self` keyword to update the value in kv files.

```python
class MyWidget(BoxLayout):
    my_button = ObjectProperty()  # Default: None

    def change_text(self):
        if self.my_button:
            self.my_button.text = "Clicked!"  # Updates Button text

---

<MyWidget>:
    my_button: my_btn  # Reference from KV

    Button:
        id: my_btn  # Linked to my_button
        text: "Press Me"
        on_press: root.change_text()
```

## Graphics

In Kivy, it uses the OpenGL and Canvas API to render.

Every widget has a canvas, where you can draw primitives (like rectangles, lines, images, etc.).

Kivy has 3 main canvas sections:

- canvas.before â†’ Executes before the widgetâ€™s main rendering.
- canvas â†’ Executes during normal rendering (default).
- canvas.after â†’ Executes after the widgetâ€™s rendering (on top).

âœ… Use canvas.before for backgrounds.
âœ… Use canvas.after for overlays / effects.
âœ… Use self.canvas in Python for dynamic shapes.

ðŸ”¹ Graphics Instructions in Kivy
Kivy's graphics system is divided into two types of instructions:

- Context Instructions â†’ Modify the rendering state (e.g., color, transformation).
- Vertex Instructions â†’ Define what gets drawn (e.g., rectangles, lines, shapes).

```
<MyWidget>:
    canvas:
        Color:
            rgba: 1, 0, 0, 1  # Red color
        Rotate:
            angle: 45
            origin: self.center
```

        Rotate:
            angle: 30
            origin: self.center
        Rectangle:
            pos: self.pos
            size: self.size
```

## FAQ

- In Kivy, when you import a widget in one .kv file, it becomes available globally within the Kivy application. This means that if you import IconButton in main.kv, it will be recognized and can be used in other .kv files, such as home.kv, without needing to import it again.

Here's how it works:

Global Namespace: When you import a widget in a .kv file, Kivy adds it to the global namespace. This allows the widget to be used in any other .kv file within the same application.

Import in main.kv: In your main.kv file, you have imported IconButton:

- RoundedEdges on Button
  This is a tricky one. As far as I am concern Widgets are always rectangles. But we can change the background and put a couple of images for the normal and down states using the background_normal and background_down properties respectively. Also you will need to understand the border property.
- Yes, that's correct. In Kivy, when you set parameters in the KV file, they are used to set the properties of the widget, not to pass arguments to the **init** function. The properties defined in the class (such as StringProperty, NumericProperty, etc.) are automatically managed by Kivy's property system.
- When you set a property in the KV file, Kivy automatically updates the corresponding property in the class instance. This means that the parameters in the KV file are used to set the properties, not to pass arguments to the **init** function.

- In Kivy, padding and spacing are used to control the layout of widgets within a container, but they serve different purposes:

  - Padding: This property adds space inside the container, between the container's border and its children. It effectively shrinks the available space for the children by the specified amount on each side.

  - Spacing: This property adds space between the children of the container. It does not affect the space between the container's border and its children, only the space between the children themselves.

  ```
  <Home>:
      padding: dp(14) # Adds 14dp of space inside the container's border
      spacing: dp(16) # Adds 16dp of space between each child widget
  ```

`size_hint`

- Definition: size_hint is a tuple of two values, (size_hint_x, size_hint_y), which represent the width and height proportions relative to the parent container.
- Usage: When you set size_hint, you are specifying how much of the parent container's size the widget should take up. The values are typically between 0 and 1, where 1 means 100% of the parent's size.

`size`

- Definition: size is a tuple of two values, (width, height), which represent the explicit size of the widget in pixels (or density-independent pixels, dp).
- 3Usage: When you set size, you are specifying the exact size of the widget. To use size, you must set size_hint to None for the corresponding dimension.

```
BoxLayout:
    orientation: 'vertical'
    Button:
        text: "Button 1"
        size_hint: None, None
        size: dp(100), dp(50)  # Explicitly sets the size to 100dp by 50dp
    Button:
        text: "Button 2"
        size_hint: 1, None
        height: dp(50)  # Takes up 100% of the parent's width and has a height of 50dp
```

### Layout

### AnchorLayout

AnchorLayout is used to position its child widgets at a specified anchor point within its bounding box. You can align widgets to the center, top, bottom, left, right, or any combination of these positions.

Properties:

- anchor_x: Specifies the horizontal alignment. Possible values are 'left', 'center', and 'right'.
- anchor_y: Specifies the vertical alignment. Possible values are 'top', 'center', and 'bottom'.

```
AnchorLayout:
    anchor_x: 'center'
    anchor_y: 'center'
    Button:
        text: "Centered Button"
```

### GridLayout

GridLayout arranges its children in a grid with a specified number of columns and rows. It is useful for creating layouts where widgets need to be aligned in a tabular format.

Properties:

- cols: Number of columns in the grid.
- rows: Number of rows in the grid.
- col_default_width: Default width of each column.
- row_default_height: Default height of each row.
- col_force_default: If True, forces each column to have the default width.
- row_force_default: If True, forces each row to have the default height.

```
GridLayout:
    cols: 2
    rows: 2
    Button:
        text: "Button 1"
    Button:
        text: "Button 2"
    Button:
        text: "Button 3"
    Button:
        text: "Button 4"
```

## Kivy's Coordinate System

Origin (0,0) is at the bottom-left corner of the window (not top-left like in HTML/CSS).
X-axis (width) grows from left to right.
Y-axis (height) grows from bottom to top

Since by default the first child on the bottom, use the AnchorLayout and set the anchor_y to be on 'top'
